# genderedageism

This github contains all of the replication materials for Guilbeault, Delecourt, and Desikan 2024, "The Invisibility of Older Women Online"

This git contains: <br>
-R scripts for replicating all main and supplementary analyses from the raw data. The name of the R script and header text in the script specify which analyses it replicates from the manuscript and SI. <br>
-The raw data for all observational analyses and experiments<br>

Notes:

_1.3. The data associated with the Wikipedia-based Image Text Dataset is from the following paper:_ <br>
<br>
Srinivasan, Krishna, Karthik Raman, Jiecao Chen, Michael Bendersky, and Marc Najork. “WIT: Wikipedia-Based Image Text Dataset for Multimodal Multilingual Machine Learning.” In Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2443–49.

The WIT data did not originally contain the age and gender classifications. Our dataset includes the gender, age, and social category classifications for images from this data, which we collected using human crowdsourcing from Mturk (see full paper for methodological details).
