_1.3. The data associated with the Wikipedia-based Image Text Dataset ("Wiki_data.csv") is from the following paper:_ <br>
<br>
Srinivasan, Krishna, Karthik Raman, Jiecao Chen, Michael Bendersky, and Marc Najork. “WIT: Wikipedia-Based Image Text Dataset for Multimodal Multilingual Machine Learning.” In Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2443–49.

The WIT data did not originally contain the age and gender classifications. Our dataset includes the gender, age, and social category classifications for images from this data, which we collected using human crowdsourcing from Mturk (see full paper for methodological details).
