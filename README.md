# genderedageism

This github contains all of the replication materials for Guilbeault & Delecourt, 2022, "Women are Depicted as Significantly Younger than Men in over One Million Images from Google, Wikipedia, and IMDb"

This git contains: 

-An r script for replicating all main and supplementary analyses from the raw data. 

-The raw data for all experiments

1.1. The data associated with the IMDb-Wiki Dataset ("imdb_age_celeb.csv" and "wiki_age_celeb.csv") is from the following paper: 

Rothe, Rasmus, Radu Timofte, and Luc Van Gool. “Deep Expectation of Real and Apparent Age from a Single Image Without Facial Landmarks.” International Journal of Computer Vision 126, no. 2 (April 1, 2018): 144–57. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-016-0940-3.

1.2. The data associated with the Cross-age Celebrity Dataset ("CACD.csv") is from the following paper: 

Chen, Bor-Chun, Chu-Song Chen, and Winston H. Hsu. “Cross-Age Reference Coding for Age-Invariant Face Recognition and Retrieval.” In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, edited by David Fleet, Tomas Pajdla, Bernt Schiele, and Tinne Tuytelaars, 768–83. Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10599-4_49.

1.3. The data associated with the Wikipedia-based Image Text Dataset ("Wiki_experiment_full_final_pub.csv") is from the following paper: 

Srinivasan, Krishna, Karthik Raman, Jiecao Chen, Michael Bendersky, and Marc Najork. “WIT: Wikipedia-Based Image Text Dataset for Multimodal Multilingual Machine Learning.” In Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2443–49. New York, NY, USA: Association for Computing Machinery, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1145/3404835.3463257.

The WIT data did not originally contain the age and gender classifications. Our dataset includes the gender, age, and social category classifications for images from this data, which we collected using human crowdsourcing from Mturk (see full paper for methodological details).
